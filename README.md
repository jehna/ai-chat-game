# AI chat game prototype

This is a quick prototype game that uses the [EleutherAI GPT-Neo
2.7B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B) text generation neural
network as the main gameplay interaction. Not exactly GPT-3, but seems to work
well enough for the use case.

This prototype is using the model hosted at [HuggigFace
ðŸ¤—](https://huggingface.co/), which uses input character count as main billing
criteria. This means all requests cost some money, so scaling up this may need
some monetisation from day one.

## Development

Created using basic create-react app, so you know the drill:

```yarn && yarn start```

You need to add the environment variable `REACT_APP_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` to get
the API to work. Use `.env` file locally.
