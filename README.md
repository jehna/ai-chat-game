# Prototype GPT-J-6B game

This is a quick prototype game that uses the [EleutherAI
GPT-J-6B](https://6b.eleuther.ai/) text generation neural network as the main
gameplay interaction.

This quick prototype is using EleutherAI's demo instance (sorry!). But they have
CORS headers that allow requests from any origin, so it's an indicator they
might allow this kind of thing.

The demo instance is pretty slow though, so expect ~1 min response times.

Created using basic create-react app.
